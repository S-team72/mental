  <h1>Panic Attacks and Online Psychiatry</h1>

  <p><strong>Panic attacks</strong> are sudden and intense episodes of fear that often come without warning. They can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and the overwhelming sense that something terrible is about to happen.</p>

  <p>In many cases, people avoid seeking help due to fear of judgment or lack of access to local care. <strong>Online psychiatric consultations</strong> provide a private, convenient, and effective solution â€” allowing you to receive help from a licensed psychiatrist without leaving your home.</p>

  <h2>Benefits of Online Psychiatric Support</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comfort and privacy from your own space</li>
    <li>Flexible scheduling, including evenings or weekends</li>
    <li>Confidential, encrypted communication</li>
    <li>Ongoing support for anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and more</li>
  </ul>
